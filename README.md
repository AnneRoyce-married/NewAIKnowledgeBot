?? How It Works
User uploads a .txt file.

The backend extracts and splits text into chunks.

Each chunk is converted into a vector using OpenAI's Embedding API.

When the user asks a question:

The question is also embedded.

The most relevant chunks are selected using cosine similarity.

A prompt is created using these chunks + the question.

The prompt is sent to GPT (gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4).

GPT returns an answer based on the context and question.
